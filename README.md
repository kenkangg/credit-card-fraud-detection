# Credit Card Fraud Detection Investigation

Credit card fraud has become a common problem in the past decades as the primary form of payment in first world countries shift from physical to digital. In recent years, data of fraudulent transactions has become more accessible. The purpose of this investigation was to find a way to accurately detect future fraud using machine learning. The dataset that was used was released by Kaggle and contains transactions made by Europeans in September 2013.

## Dataset

The data used to train the machine learning models can be found on Kaggle at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud/data)
